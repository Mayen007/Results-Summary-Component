## Overview

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- **Bonus**: Use local JSON data to dynamically populate the content.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced using **CSS custom properties** for theme consistency and **Flexbox** for responsive layouts. Additionally, I applied **CSS gradients** and **inset shadows** to create depth in the score display component.

Hereâ€™s a snippet showing the CSS for the score display depth effect:

```css
.result-display {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--light-slate-blue-bg), var(--light-royal-blue-bg));
  box-shadow: inset 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
```
### Continued Development

I plan to continue focusing on:

- Enhancing responsive design techniques for complex layouts.
- Experimenting with CSS animations and transitions to improve UI/UX.
- Furthering my JavaScript skills to dynamically populate content from JSON data.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Inset Shadows](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/#inset-shadows) - This helped me understand how to create inset shadows for depth.
- [Frontend Mentor Slack Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) - The community feedback helped me refine my solution, especially in CSS styling.
